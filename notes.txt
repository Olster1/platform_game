//NOT URGENT: 
[] When you select item why is the camera Z - pos instead of reverse
[] Make camera more responsive 
[] Draw player last & change depth buffer to <=

//ENGINE 
[] Put platform invisible structures for platforms in the y-axis
[] change undo to circular buffer
[] Do basic AI for NPC character

[] Have a push renderer to buffer openGL calls -> the font rendering is slow
[] Have player progress saved -> new directory that loads on top and has things like solved & saved positions of entities

[] Introspect the different types data -> edit note parent sequence

//GAME-PLAY
[] Have pop up of how successful you are in the note puzzle -> fade away when you get one wrong 
[] Have notes that can be anything and you can program bots to fill them in -> platforms moving up and notes on ledges 
[] Control note playing timers -> blocks coming down to play notes
[] Have time based note puzzles -> have a line moving across the note helper 
[] Change pattern matching note buffer to a fixed sized array -> size if as many notes a pattern can have.
